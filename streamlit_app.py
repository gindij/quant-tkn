            The ta'amim, or cantillation marks, are a set of symbols used in the Hebrew Bible to indicate the
            melodic chanting of the text, and also to instruct the reader about correct pronunciation and rhythm.
            Often, when preparing to read a particular Torah portion, I find myself thinking about basic statistical
            questions that it would be difficult to answer manually, such as how often certain combinations of ta'amim
            appear together, or how often a particular ta'am appears in a given book. This app aims to provide a simple,
            one-stop solution for answering these types of questions. The hope is that over time, we can build up an
            interesting collection of quantitative analyses of the ta'amim, and perhaps even discover some new insights
            into the structure of the Hebrew Bible.
